### Decorators
Decorators are provided by python for the modification of
of functions or classes. We will begin with  examples
of decarators applied to function and end with examples of 
decorators applied to classes. 
-------
First a _decorator_ is a way of placing a function within another function. This allows nesting of 
functions without rewriting the underlying function. We can do
this because functions are first class objects.

Let's begin by considering something a little more concrete.
such as simple addition function.

```python
def addone(n):
    """
    adds 1 to number
    """
    print('adding 1 to {}'.format(n))
    return n +1
â€‹
```

Now let's try it out
```
print(addone(1))
adding 1 to 1
2

```
What happens if nest functions
```
print(addone(addone(addone(1))))
      
adding 1 to 1
adding 1 to 2
adding 1 to 3
4


```
You can see above that we call the function 3 times and it returns
a value that is operated  on by the next function.
Pretty standard review. What if instead of asking a function to return
an integer we wanted it to return a function. How would we write that code?
------------

Making a function return a function

There are several examples of this online, but we can make our own here.
Here we write a function that will output another function. We will insert
print statement to show when the function is used.

```python
def addN(N):
    """
    return a function that adds N to each number given
    """
    
    #Print statement to show 
    print("""
    Using addN
    """)
    
    def addIt(i):
          print("""
          Using addIt
          """)
          return i +N
    return addIt # notice addIt is returned as an object not 
    # a called function. Modify your own code to include bracketts 
    # and see what happens.

```

Let's see what happens when we `print()` the object `addN()`  returns

```python
add3 = addN(3)

  Using addN
  
```
We can inspect the variable using `type()`

```python
print(type(add3))
<class 'function'>

```
Excellent we have a function that has been returned. Now we can see it
in action.

```python
add3(5)

          Using addIt
          
8

```

Our `print()` confirms which function is being used.
------------------

Using decorators to modify functions.

Decorators are functions that take in functions and return modified functions.
`addN()` takes in an int and returns a function. Let's try making a function to modify addone()

 ```python
def lessLonely(func):
    def decorated(*args):
        print("In decorated")
        print('{} is less lonely than {}'.format(*args,0)) # here we assume that whatever number we put in is less 
        # lonely than 0... whatever that means.
        
        print("leaving decorated")
        return func(*args)
    return decorated




@lessLonely
def addone(n):
    """
    adds 1 to number
    """
    print('in addone\nadding 1 to {}'.format(n))
    print('leaving addone()')
    return n +1
    print('out')

```
If we look at the output we can see that it goes into `lessLonely()` first and then into `addone()`.

```
print(addone(3)

In decorated
3 is less lonely than 0
leaving decorated
in addone
adding 1 to 3
leaving addone()
4
```
What happens if we want to make our lessLonely output reference the output of `addone()` during the print statement?



```python

def lessLonely(func):
    def decorated(*args):
        print("In decorated")
        print('{} is less lonely than {}'.format(*args,func(*args)))
        print("leaving decorated")
        return func(*args)
    return decorated




@lessLonely
def addone(n):
    """
    adds 1 to number
    """
    print('in addone\nadding 1 to {}'.format(n))
    print('leaving addone()')
    return n +1
    print('out')


In decorated        # Same as before
in addone           # we call addone() during the print statement
adding 1 to 3       # Caluculating for the printstatment
leaving addone()    
3 is less lonely than 4 # returns value back to lessLonely()
leaving decorated   
in addone           #recalculates values again for 
adding 1 to 3
leaving addone()
4                   # returns 4 to global scope.


```

These print statements are getting pretty messy, let's use a different method. Here we will define a function
for printing out the arguments  in a function `printargs()`. And add memoization through 
functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None) Memoization caches the function output everytime a value is passed to function.
If the value has been seen before it returns the known output instead of calling the function.

```python
import functools 
def printargs(func):
    def decorated(*args,**kwargs):
        print("Function{} called with args = {} and kwargs -{}".format(func.__name__,args,kwargs))
        return func(*args,**kwargs)
    return decorated

@printargs
def lessLonely(func):
    def decorated(*args):
        print('{} is less lonely than {}'.format(*args,func(*args)))
        return func(*args)
    return decorated

print('start addone()')

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None) 
@lessLonely
@printargs
def addone(n):
    """
    adds 1 to number
    """
    return n +1

print("start\n\n\n")
print("first:",addone(3))
print("second:",addone(3))
print("third:" ,addone(3))
```

when we call modifed `addone()`
```python

print("first:",addone(3))
print("second:",addone(3))
print("third:" ,addone(3))

Functionaddone called with args = (3,) and kwargs -{} # addone() called during string formatting
3 is less lonely than 4                               # string is output
Functionaddone called with args = (3,) and kwargs -{} ## addone() called to return value
first: 4
second: 4 # no functions called but the correct value is returned via memoization.
third: 4  #  same as above.

```

Let's look at some real python.
